# Data Scientist/ Data Analyst/ Geophysicist.

## Professional summary
As a proven and passionate data scientist, I derive joy through using my data experience in creating insights, developing and implementing recommender system models, predictive models, data researcher, conducting statistical analyses, and creating visualizations to communicate structured and unstructured data insight and in all, i aim at making beneficial decisions with all these tools. I'm always open to new ideas and ways I can improve, and become a professional and sound data scientist.

## Projects
### Project 1: Loan Prediction App Project
[Publication](https://github.com/Sophiajackrich/Stutern-repo/blob/main/loan%20app%20prediction%204.ipynb)
#### Skills:
###### *Python*, *numpy*, *Pandas*, *Matplotlib*, *Seaborn*, *Scikit-learn*, *Machine learning*, *Joblib* e.t.c.

My team and I developed a loan prediction data science app that evaluates if an applicant is eligible for approval or not. 
Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn were used. For the model The Random Forest and Linear Regression were also used. The FastApi app model was used to create the app.

### Project 2: Visualization of Mock data 
[Publication](https://github.com/Sophiajackrich/Stutern-repo/blob/main/Visualization_by_Sophia.ipynb)
#### Skills:
###### *Python*, *numpy*, *Matplotlib*, *Seaborn*.

I analyzed and derived insight from exploring this data of Array A against Array B.
This was done by creating a mock dataset of Array A and Array B, performed data cleaning by checking if there were duplicates and incorrect data.
Lastly, i explored the data by using the essential tools of Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### Project 3: Analysis of an Attrition Project
[Publication](https://github.com/Sophiajackrich/Stutern-repo/blob/main/Sophia's_Attrition_project.ipynb)
#### Skills:
###### *Python*, *numpy*, *Pandas*, *Matplotlib*, *Seaborn*, *Scikit-learn*, e.t.c.

In this project, i extracted data from my stutern class site on the attrition of employees which contained over 30 features of the employees.
This was done with the aim of extracting information on why employees leave or resign from the company without the company getting their replacements.

### Project 4: SQL
[Publication](https://github.com/Sophiajackrich/Stutern-repo/blob/main/SQL_Assignment_2.ipynb)
#### Skills:
###### *SQL*, *Cross-Join*, *Pandas*, e.t.c.

The analysis here, was performed using the experience of 'SQL' knowledge developed from my time with Stutern company. 
This analysis shows different employees features(name, salary and department name) with the aim of using a 'Cross-Join' to find the all employees working in 'IT' and 'Sales' department.

## Trainee Experience
##### **Data Science Trainee @ Stutern (_May 2023 - Present_)**
As a Data Science trainee at Stutern, some of my duties include: 
1. Learning Data Science concepts such as Data Cleaning, Data Exploration, Data Visualization, Data Analysis and Machine Learning.
2. Working with Data Science Tools like: **Python, SQL, Power BI, and Jupyter Notebook/Lab**
3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: I learnt how to clean and preprocess data using various tools and techniques to make it ready for analysis.
4. Data Visualization: I was taught how to visualize data usingtools like Power BI, Python Mathplotlib, Pandas Seaborn to communicate insights effectively.
5. Statistical Analysis: Here, i was taught how to perform statistical analysis on data to identify trends, patterns and relationships.
6. Machine Learning: I learnt how to apply machine learning algorithms to solve rea-world problems using scikit learn library. e.t.c.
7. Communication: I learnt how to communicate  effectively in my beginners stage at Stutern through the task of Introducing "SQL" to my fellow trainees and helping solve assignment problems.
8. Leadership and Team Role playing: In the course of my Stutern Intermediate stage, i was the assistant leader of my assigned group, were i helped my group in our daily tasks and given asssignments. This helpedme develop a good working team and a positive partnership with my group nleader and other group team leaders till date. e.t.c.
